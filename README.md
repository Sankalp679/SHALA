After finishing the ML/DL courses, I completed a few projects on [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects), as given below. These projects made me utilize both ML and DL skills using Python. 

* [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/558)
* [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/619)
* [Do Left-handed People Really Die Young?](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/479)
