# **Project Description**
Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey; so were Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A [1991 study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104043241418) reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true?

In this project, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses `pandas` and **Bayesian statistics** to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.

## Project Tasks

* Where are the old left-handed people?
* Rates of left-handedness over time
* Applying Bayes' rule
* When do people normally die?
* The overall probability of left-handedness
* Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (i)
* Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (ii)
* Plotting the distributions of conditional probabilities
* Moment of truth: age of left and right-handers at death
* Final comments
